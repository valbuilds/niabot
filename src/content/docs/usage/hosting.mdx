:::tip
For cheap and affordable hosting, I recommend [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free) or [Linode (Akamai)](https://www.linode.com/lp/free-credit-short/).

You get a free [90-day $300 credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial) on Google Cloud, and a free 60-day $100 credit with Linode. *Terms apply.*

Read the [Recommended Specifications section](#recommended-specifications) to see what specs are recommended and how much hosting costs on a few hosting platforms.

:::

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.5 or higher
- PiP package manager
- *(not required but very much recommended) A virtual environment*
- A little knowledge on coding in Python and how to edit `.json` files.

## Packages used

:::tip
For each of these packages, run `pip install <package name>` to install the package.
:::

- `discord.py[voice]`
- `python-dotenv`
- `peewee`
- `requests`

:::caution
I might have missed some packages. **Please [open an issue on the Github repo](https://github.com/valbuilds/niabot/issues/new) if you run into any issues.**
